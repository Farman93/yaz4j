In order to built yaz4j the Java JDK, ant, YAZ and Swig must be installed.
The exact process varies from platform to platform.

For example, on Ubuntu/Debian the following installs the components:
  apt-get install sun-java6-jdk ant libyaz3-dev swig

The compilation is a two-step process. The environment variable JAVA_HOME
should point to the Java JDK of your preference. For example,
  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun

Build the shared libary (.so) with:
  cd libyaz4j
  ./build.sh

Rest is built by ant which reads build.xml:
  cd ..
  ant

If you network-connected you should be able to run tests with:
  ant unit-test
