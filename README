yaz4j is a Java wrapper for the ZOOM API of YAZ. This allows developers
to write Z39.50 clients in Java.

In order to built yaz4j the Java JDK, Maven, YAZ and Swig must be installed.
The exact process varies from platform to platform.

For example, on Ubuntu/Debian the following installs the components:
  apt-get install sun-java6-jdk maven2 libyaz3-dev swig

The compilation for native code (JNI) is performed by good old make.
Adjust libyaz4j/Makefile as necessary. Tune JAVA_HOME and perhaps path to
yaz-config in the Makefile.

The Maven pom.xml will automatically invoke libyaz4j/Makefile , so
this is what it takes:
  mvn compile

If you network-connected you should be able to run tests with:
  mvn test
