Unix
----

'yaz-config' is assumed to be on the Path, if it isn't or if local yaz
installation is to be used it's location can be forced with:

mvn -Dyaz.config=/path/to/yaz-config install


Windows
-------

Sensible defaults are assumed for 'yaz.path' and 'swig' binary. Both
can be overriden though

mvn -Dyaz.path=/path/to/yaz/installation -Dswig=/path/to/swig/binary install


Visual Studio binaries must be available on the path, see
