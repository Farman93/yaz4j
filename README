COMPILATION

Unix
----

You will need the JDK, maven, swig and yaz development packages.
Consult your package manager on how to install those.

'yaz-config' is assumed to be on the Path, if it isn't or if local yaz
installation is to be used it's location can be forced with:

mvn -Dyaz.config=/path/to/yaz-config install


Windows
-------

Besides the exact same requirement as in the unix case, you will need
the Windows SDK installed (which in turn requires .NET Framework 4).

Sensible defaults are assumed for 'yaz.path' and the 'swig' binary. Both
can be overriden through:

mvn -Dyaz.path=/path/to/yaz/installation -Dswig=/path/to/swig/binary install

Use the command prompt provided with the Windows SDK.
